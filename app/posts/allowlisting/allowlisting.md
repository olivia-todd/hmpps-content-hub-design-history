<p>In alpha, we tested different tools and processes that staff can use to prepare and receive a person arriving at prison to:</p>

<ul>
	<li>ensure correct identification</li>
	<li>increase awareness of signs of risk</li>
	<li>create a better arrival experience</li>
</ul>

<p>We created prototypes to test each prioritised hypothesis, not proposed solutions.</p>
