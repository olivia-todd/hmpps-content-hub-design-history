## When content demand outweighs supply

Users continuously ask through our feedback mechanism for more content. We regularly analyse our feedback and each time, a significant proportion is for specific content or feature requests. This is understandable. One of the main appeals of the “regular” internet is its novelty and a seemingly unending supply of newness.

However, our small team cannot reasonably self-produce all of this content from scratch. We also cannot afford to continually find, upload and maintain appropriate content that exists elsewhere.

Our CMS limitations also mean that our users cannot interact with content in any way. Most of our sourced content (that we haven’t created ourselves) is static. Our users can’t fill out a survey or a quiz. In this way, the Hub functions as a somewhat cloistered miniverse. By ringfencing access to other sites, we may not be adequately preparing users for using the wider internet when they return to the community.

### Our assumptions

We believe that selectively granting access to specific, pre-authorised sites (or “allowlisting”, as we’re calling it) would be beneficial.

For our users, it would mean:

- there’ll always be something new to read, do, watch, or listen to
- getting the most up-to-date content — for example, prison rules and policies which currently live on GOV.UK 
- content comes directly from the experts
- using selected parts of the “normal” internet may improve digital skills and prepare our users better for life post-release 

For our team, it would mean:

- the Hub does not stagnate while we source new content
- less duplication of what exists on the internet already, which is greener for the planet
- less manual maintenance by our team of outdated content and PDFs 
- we can reclaim this otherwise lost time to focus on creating authentic-voice or prison-specific content
- reduced hosting costs if we’re no longer storing archived content
