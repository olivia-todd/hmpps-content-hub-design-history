Design principles are the values that guide the design of our service. We’ll use these principles at every stage of the design process to make sure we’re moving in the right direction.

## Our design principles

Our design principles have been created by the Receive a Prisoner team. They reflect the values and goals of the project we’re working on, the overarching values of the Ministry of Justice and the GDS service standard.

### Respect people and their environment
